# Note from Project Euler website

We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by
publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond the first one-hundred
problems will have their accounts locked.

If you are keen to share your insights and/or wish to see how other members have solved the problem, then please visit
problem thread in our private discussion forum.
